# Botlistus

## Overview
This Discord bot is a project by Calistus, with the ultimate goal of learning Python3 while also having something to show for it.
Ultimately, this bot may not offer any features that are not already provided in some form by another Discord bot.

## Features
**MTG:**
- [x] **Card Search**  
Returns Oracle text/card price via commands, using the [Scryfall API](https://scryfall.com/docs/api-overview).

## Planned Features
**Bot:** 
- [ ] **Features As Extensions**  
Split features off into individual files to be used as extensions.

- [ ] **Fully Commented Code**  
Learning how to do this by myself was a challenge, and I still have a long ways to go in many regards.  That being said, I'd like to help other new coders out by commenting my code, with extra attention to the stumbling blocks I experienced.

**General:** 
- [ ] **Role Requests**  
Allow the bot to grant/remove roles on request for access to certain channels/features that may be spammy.

**Dustforce:** 
- [ ] **Atlas RSS Feed Updates**  
Watches the Atlas RSS feed for new maps, and posts them to Discord.

- [ ] **Old Ranks**  
Posts ranks in golf style for top 10s in Dustforce via a command.

- [ ] **Random Map**  
Posts a random Atlas map via a command.

**MTG:**
- [ ] **Custom Card Nickname List**  
Allow users to add/remove card nicknames to/from a list via a command.
